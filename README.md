# **Sign-Up Flow Analysis**

##  **Project Overview**
This project analyzes the **sign-up flow** of users for a platform using **MySQL**. 
The goal is to extract meaningful insights regarding user behavior, sign-up errors, and conversion rates. 

**The dataset consists of five key tables:** 

- **`actions`** – Tracks user actions throughout the sign-up process.  
- **`error_messages`** – Logs any errors encountered during the sign-up process.  
- **`sessions`** – Records user sessions, helping to track user engagement.  
- **`students`** – Contains details of registered users.  
- **`students_purchases`** – Captures purchase activities of registered users.  
- **`visitors`** – Contains information on visitors landing on the platform.

## **Objective**
The primary objective of this analysis is to understand and optimize the sign-up process by:
- Analyzing **conversion rates** from visitor to registered user.
- Identifying the **number of registered users** over time.
- Investigating **sign-up errors** and their frequency.
- Categorizing the **types of sign-up errors** affecting user registration.

## **Tech Stack**
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Query Language**: SQL
- **Visualization**: Tableau
---
## 📊 **Key Insights** (To Be Updated)
- The **conversion rate** from visitors to registered users is **X%**.
- The total number of **registered users** over the observed period is **Y**.
- The most frequent **sign-up error** encountered is **Z**, accounting for **W%** of total errors.
- The primary cause of failed sign-ups is **[Error Type]**, which suggests improvements in the user onboarding process.
